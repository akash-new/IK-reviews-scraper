I explored a lot of different prep options before deciding on Interview Kickstart and couldn't be happier. In particular, I was looking for support with system design and behavioral interviews. I am blown away by how well-structured and thorough all of IK's content and support is. They have such a complete set of structured content that walks you through understanding everything you need to know and most importantly mastering the strategies for HOW to ace any question you're given. IK knows the interview process inside and out and is a master at breaking down the underlying strategies, so I loved how I didn't have to waste any time figuring things out on my own and could simply stay extremely focused in my preparation. In addition, the support their team offers is unparalleled. They're always checking in to make sure you have everything you need to succeed and have always gone up and beyond for any special request I've had. IK truly offers such a thorough solution so that you have everything you need in a single place to succeed. I continue to be so impressed by the level of thoughtfulness they've put into designing the curriculum and ensuring every student has the support they need.\u00a0 Couldn't recommend them more.\n\n\n\nRead MoreRead Less\n\n\n\n[Report](mailto:hello@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Interview%20Kickstart%20%7C%20All%20you%20need%20to%20prepare%20for%20Tech%20Interviews%20%7C%20id%3A%2064932) Share Helpful (2)\n\n- Volodymyr Oros\n\nConsultant on TPM \u2022 Applicant \u2022 Technical Program Manager Interview course \u2022 San Jose\n\n\n\n\n\nVerified by LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 17, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Assistance\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Best fit for my need\n\n\n\n\nI've moved to Silicon Valley and figured out that competition to FAANG companies is very high, so my interviewing skills need to be improved.

Interview Kickstart helps students strengthen their programming fundamentals and become better engineers in the process, thereby equipping them with the right set of skills required to crack tough technical interviews at top companies.\n\nBased on a student\u2019s career path, they can choose from 18 different domain-specific courses.\nThe course curriculum covers Data Structures and Algorithms, Distributed Systems, Design, Domain-Specific Concepts, and Behavioral Interviews. Students will receive support with optimizing their LinkedIn profile and leveraging LinkedIn to land FAANG interviews.\n\nInterview Kickstart gives students expert support with salary negotiation to land bigger and more lucrative offers, mock interviews with industry experts and FAANG hiring managers, one-on-one mentor sessions with technical leads and hiring managers from FAANG companies, and 18 domain courses that specialize in the highest-paying domains.\n\nThe highlight of Interview Kickstart\u2019s program is the technical interview prep. Interview Kickstart\u2019s team of 500+ instructors are hiring managers, technical leads, and hiring committee members at FAANG and Tier-1 companies. Being closely acquainted with the hiring process at top tech companies, these instructors know precisely what recruiters are looking for while hiring candidates. This gives students an edge and sets them up for success at highly competitive and challenging technical interviews at FAANG+ companies.\n\nAfter course completion, Interview Kickstart students receive an extended 6-month support period. During the support period, students can retake classes, schedule mock interviews with domain experts, have one-on-one sessions with instructors from FAANG companies, get support with optimizing their LinkedIn profile and resume, and land interviews through Interview Kickstart\u2019s wide network of alums.\n\nSince 2014, Interview Kickstart has trained over 13,500 engineers for the toughest tech interviews. Interview Kickstart alums receive multiple lucrative offers from top companies, including FAANG, Microsoft, Uber, Lyft, LinkedIn, Twitter, VMware, and more. In 2021, Interview Kickstart graduates received an average salary increase of 53%.
